\section{Fiscal Analysis: Dynamic Tariff Revenue Forecast}

\subsection{Theoretical Framework: The Dynamic Laffer Effect}
The relationship between tariff rates and fiscal revenue is governed by the Laffer Curve mechanism. However, trade volume does not react instantaneously to tariff shocks. We propose a \textbf{Dynamic Response Model} that distinguishes between short-term rigidity (contractual obligations) and medium-term elasticity (supply chain substitution).

The tariff revenue $R_t$ at time $t$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    R_t = V_t(\tau) \times \tau_t
\end{equation}
where $V_t(\tau)$ is the trade volume under tariff rate $\tau_t$. The core challenge is to model the time-varying decay of $V_t$.

\subsection{Baseline Prediction: SARIMA Model}
To establish a counterfactual baseline (imports without new tariffs), we employed the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model on historical U.S. total imports data (IMPTOTUS, 2008-2025).

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing and Stationarity}
We performed the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the logarithmic series of imports. The result (ADF Statistic: -1.8067, p-value: 0.377) indicated non-stationarity, necessitating first-order differencing ($d=1$) and seasonal differencing ($D=1$, $s=12$).

\subsubsection{Model Selection}
Through a grid search based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the optimal model structure was identified as $\text{SARIMA}(2, 1, 2) \times (1, 1, 1)_{12}$. The baseline forecast for the next 48 months is shown in Figure \ref{fig:baseline}.

\subsection{Impact Assessment: Polynomial Elasticity Fitting}
Unlike static models, we calibrated the trade elasticity $\epsilon_t$ using empirical data from the 2018-2019 Trade War.

\subsubsection{Elasticity Extraction}
We calculated the realized elasticity for each month during the 2018 trade conflict:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{real} = \frac{\%\Delta \text{Import}}{\%\Delta \text{Tariff}}
\end{equation}
To capture the nonlinear adjustment path, we fitted a 5th-degree polynomial to the observed elasticity sequence (see Figure \ref{fig:elasticity}).

    \label{fig:elasticity}
\end{figure}

The fitted polynomial captures the initial rigidity (low elasticity) and the subsequent structural adjustment (higher negative elasticity).

\subsection{Revenue Forecast under Tariff Shock}
We simulated the import volume $V_{shock}$ under the proposed reciprocal tariff policy ($\tau_{new} \approx 18\%$). The shock transmission is modeled as:
\begin{equation}
    V_{shock}(t) = V_{base}(t) \times [1 + \epsilon(t) \cdot \Delta \tau]
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon(t)$ incorporates the polynomial trend, Gaussian noise ($\sigma=0.09$), and a long-term decay factor to prevent divergence.

    \label{fig:shock}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Net Revenue Change}
The simulation results (Figure \ref{fig:shock}) indicate a \textbf{"Short-term Gain, Long-term Pain"} trajectory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 (Months 1-12):} Revenue rises significantly as trade volume remains rigid despite higher taxes.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 (Months 13-48):} The contraction in the tax base (import volume) accelerates, partially offsetting the gains from higher rates, consistent with the downward slope of the Laffer Curve.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} While the tariff hike generates an initial fiscal surplus, the erosion of the tax base suggests that the net revenue growth will diminish over the President's term.
